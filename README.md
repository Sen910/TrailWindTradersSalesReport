# Functionalities of the Project  

This project aimed to demonstrate key data analysis and visualization functionalities using **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **Python**. The main functionalities include:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Excel was used to clean and preprocess raw data, ensuring consistency and quality before further analysis.  
  - Handling missing values, formatting columns, and removing duplicates.

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**  
  - Power Query was used to extract, transform, and load data into Power BI.  
  - Applied filters, joins, and custom transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

- **Data Modeling**  
  - Power BI was used to build data models by creating relationships between tables and designing an efficient schema.  
  - Defined calculated columns and measures using **DAX** for financial metrics such as **Yearly Profit Margin**.  
  - **DAX** was also used for aggregation of metrics, such as total sales and profit, across different time periods and categories.

- **Sales & Profit Analysis**  
  - Created interactive visualizations and dashboards to display key business metrics like **sales trends**, **profit margins**, and **quarterly performance**.  
  - Used **area charts** and **bar charts** for performance tracking over time.

- **Historical Currency Data Exchange (Python)**  
  - **Python** was used to fetch and process historical currency exchange data for accurate sales and profit analysis.  
  - The currency exchange data helped in adjusting financial metrics like **Net Revenue** and **Gross Revenue** based on different currency fluctuations.
